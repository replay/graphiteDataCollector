This is a bunch of scripts which is ment to collect data about the running 
system and send it to graphite's carbon server. It's plugin based and very 
easy to extend. All plugins have to be executable and simply print out data 
in the form:

<metric> <number>

To install a plugin, simply copy its executable script or binary to 
${INSTALL_PATH}/plugins. The first part name of its filename defines in which 
interval it should be executed. For example a file with the name 5_memory.sh
will be executed every 5 minutes. To change its calling interval, simply rename
it. Remember that in Graphite's storage schema you need to match the interval
in which the data is collected. Every plugin can have its own interval.
